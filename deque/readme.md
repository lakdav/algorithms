# Deque

The deque data structure, also known as the double-ended queue, is a special
queue that allows us to insert and remove elements from the end or from the
front of the queue.

Because the deque implements both principles, FIFO and
LIFO, we can also say that the deque is a merger between the queue and the
stack data structures.
