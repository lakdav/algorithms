# Tree

root - The top node , node that does not have a parent
node - Each element of the tree

There are internal nodes and external nodes. An internal node is a node with at least one child. A node that does not have children is called an external node or a leaf.

A node in a binary tree has two children at most: one left child and one right
child.

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree, but it only allows you to store
nodes with lesser values on the left-hand side and nodes with greater values on
the right-hand side. The diagram in the previous topic exemplifies a binary
search tree.
